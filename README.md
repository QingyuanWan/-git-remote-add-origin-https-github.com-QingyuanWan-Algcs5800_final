## Collaboration Workflow


### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QingyuanWan/Algcs5800_final.git
cd Algcs5800_final
```


### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b test_git
```


example


```bash
PS I:\cs_mtal\cs2024fall\Algcs5800_final> git checkout -b test_git
>>
Switched to a new branch 'test_git'
PS I:\cs_mtal\cs2024fall\Algcs5800_final> git branch
>>
  master
* test_git
PS I:\cs_mtal\cs2024fall\Algcs5800_final>
```


### 3. Commit and Push Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m “Your change”
git push origin test_git
```


### 4. Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub to merge your feature branch into the `team-project` branch.
- Request at least one other team member to review your PR.


### 5. Merge Changes
- Once the review is approved, and all tests pass, merge the PR.



## Collaboration Workflow(If use Git app)
GitHub Setting up your branch Instructions: 
Go to file "Clone repository" Select Project tied with
Once it finishes cloning: Go to "Branch" --> "New Branch"
Name your Branch "FirstInitialLastName"
"Publish branch"
Finished.

How to properly Start working in GitHub: 
Make sure you're on your made branch
Hit "Fetch Origin"
Go to YOUR Branch select: "Update from main"
Wait it will either say push or "is already up to date with main"
Clock-In for the day at ⁠clock in-and-clock-out-tracker following the pinned comment in the channel for clocking in
Clock-Out for the day at clock in-and-clock-out-tracker following the pinned comment in the channel for clocking out

How to Properly Finish working in Github: 
Choice 1:
Commit work to your branch
Push commit, if any conflicts occur always use main!!!
Change branch to main
Go to Branch select "merge into current branch"
Push, if any conflicts occur always use main!!!
Return to your made branch

Choice 2:
Commit work to your branch
Push commit,  if any conflicts occur always use main!!!
Hit preview pull request and keep hitting blue button till says merge to main
If conflicts appear always use main or contact a lead for assistance on merging

If you see something checked out that you need to work on: 
Contact who's working on that and see if it's been pushed to main
If not let them know you need it and to report to you when it's available again

Do not work on something when someone else has it checked out
you will have to redo what you did.
